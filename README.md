# ShortestWay
This repository stores an algorithm to search the shortest way of a map. I uses trees to draw all possible ways and returns the shortest way to get to the goal. The maps is represented with a text file that contains the characters "0", "1", "A" and "B". Where "A" is the start, "B" is the goal, "1" means the paths where it can go and "0" where it can't go.

You can edit the map as you want and experiment with it.
